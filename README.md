## About project > Photos of device
I have assembled few watches and using it as my everyday watch for over a year. 
My device has battery about 80mAh capacity and works about 5 days for one charge.
Other device with 250mAh battery lasts about 2 weeks for one charge.
According to my tests, time error can't be noticed in 1 mounth perspective: RTC is very precise.

Here's some photos of watches with SLS case:

## About project > Typical problems
Regarding watches: they have two typical problems.
1) Water. There is essentially no protection against water, so you need to avoid getting water on them, and especially inside.
2) Statics. Static can occur when plugged into a charger, or when putting on/taking off a sweater or other synthetic clothing.
Therefore, the watch must either be removed for a while, or move slowly so that static in large quantities does not have time to form.


If static has already affected the clock, then:
- usually the display suffers first, there are artifacts. For six months, I had this happen 5 times. 
In this case, the watch can be reset (hold down the top button until you see the loading animation).
- A complete freeze of the controller may occur up to the impossibility of rebooting. 
Then you need to disassemble the watch and reconnect the battery, or wait for the battery to be FULLY discharged and then charge the fully discharged watch.
In the meantime, time will slip. (In my six months of use, this was 1 time).
- The controller may also be affected. (in theory, in practice I havenâ€™t had this for half a year of use)
In this case, it needs to be replaced with a new one (solder the microcircuit)

There is no auto-exit from this menu, so if you leave watch untouched in this mode, it will discharge and power off (time will reset).

Information shown:
- `VLT`: Current battery voltage detected by Arduino.
Allows to check if voltage reading is correct and calibrate values if needed.
Value interpreting is 4092 = 4.092v.
Also this value indicated in battery indicator, but in form of bars.
- `RAM`: Remaining free RAM in runtime. 
To prevent overfilling while implementing new functions.
Value is in bytes. Also this value indicated in serial log when mode changes.
- `CHG`: Status of connected charger. 
Helps debug charger detection.
1 means charger connected, 0 means no charger connected.
Also this value indicated on battery indicator as lightning near icon.
- `aLD`: Last day (of month) when alarm was run.
Helps to debug alarm and process behavior on "empty" brand new Arduinos without any settings.
Value is important because it is not indicated anywhere else.
- `WTF`: Current value of selected watchface index.
System has protection in case of incorreclty set watchface number, 
so only way to get know about data in memory is this value.
Helps to process behavior on "empty" brand new Arduinos without any settings.

# Hardware
<p align="center"><img src="Photos/2022-03-02 Hardware-and-case.jpg" width="400"/></p>
If you want to assemble your own DRM Watch, this block is for you:)
To assemble watch, you will need: <b>circuit board, parts or modules to desolder, case</b>. 
Also, some instruments, much time and some experience.

## Hardware > Used parts
- Arduino Nano (MEGA328P chip)
- Nokia 1280 LCD (PCF8814 chip)
- RTC module (DS3231M chip)
- Li-Po charger module (TC4056A chip)

To get components I've desoldered modules. 
Why desoldering instead of buying components separately?
Because I had a lot of situations when received defective chips out of the box.
Buying modules can be more expencive, but more reliable.

## Hardware > Case 3D Model
You can fing STL files for DRM Watch case in `Case` folder. 
There's 2 types of case available. 
You can edit both of my cases for you, use my Fusion 360 project: `DRM Watch v85.f3d`.
<p align="center">
<img src="Photos/Screenshot 2023-04-08 161535.jpg" height="150"/>

<img src="Photos/Screenshot 2023-04-08 161426.jpg" height="150"/>
</p>

One is more fancy, but can't be printed on FDM printer, better is to order SLS printing. 
You can fing use files `2022-10-12 Back v38.stl` and `2022-10-06 Front v35.stl`.
<p align="center">
<img src="Photos/Screenshot 2022-03-01 224852.jpg" height="270"/>
<img src="Photos/Screenshot 2022-03-01 224938.jpg" height="270"/>
</p>

Second is adapted to FDM printing. Now it's files `Front Case FDM v85.stl` and `Back Case FDM v85.stl`.

## Hardware > Assembly instruction
### General way to assemble watch:
- Order PCB using `gerber` files, Get all [parts you needed](Photos/photo_2022-01-11_15-28-52.jpg), desolder modules;
- At first, solder parts from Arduino and Lipo charger modules, Double-check all the connections, especially for shorts between chip pins, Let board cool down before testing;
- Connect battery and check if no fire or heat from PCB, Connect charger and check current. Normal value is about 200mA (or about 1A if you did not replacd 1.2K resistance), Don't connect USB without battery - board will not work this way.
- Connect board to USB. If modules works properly, PC will recognize CH340G as connected device;
- If needed, install driver for CH340G: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqUo6f5WEd1vqdxt1UWzDh4OgjdQ7Mx1/view ;
- If needed, install Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software ;
- Copy libraries to your Arduino IDE libraries folder;
- Build project and try to flash firmware. If [flashing successful](Photos/photo_2022-02-17_21-01-05.jpg), you can continue. [Normal log for this state](Photos/photo_2022-02-17_21-01-24.jpg) ;
- Now you can solder RTC, buttons, buzzer, LCD. [Photo](Photos/photo_2022-02-17_22-31-56.jpg) ;
- If successful, watch will turn on, play sound and [show time](Photos/photo_2022-02-17_22-41-40.jpg);
- If any of functions is not working, always keep in mind that any module can be defective out of the box, so you need to have spare ones to replace;
- If all works, carefully wash flux all over the board.
- Now you can assemble device to case and start using it :)

## Hardware > Troubleshooting

### No any activity after connecting battery
- Battery protection is blocking power. Connect to USB or charger to start BMS.
- Connect charger and check for current by USB Charger Doctor. Correct value is about 200-600mA.
- Check if battery protection ICs soldered in correct orientation.
- Check voltage on Arduino.
- Replace battery protection ICs and its related components.

### No device connected or Unrecognized device on PC when USB connected
- Check if CH340 is soldered in correct orientation. 
- Check or replace resonator (if any). 
- Check USB wiring.
- Check if USB contacts is dirty.
- Wipe flux from USB port.
- Check for shorts between chip pins.
- Replace CH340 and its related components.

### No response from board when trying to flash firmware.
- Check if Atmel328 is soldered in correct orientation.
- Check your Arduino. (if pin13 LED is blinking when power on, arduino is alive) 
- Check wiring from CH340 to Atmel328.
- Check if resistance for UART line is not broken.
- Check if capacitance for RESET pin is not broken or shorted.
- Check for shorts between chip pins.
- Wipe flux from board.
- Replace CH340 and Atmel328 and its related components.

### Arduino is not working, pin13 LED is not blinking
- Check if Atmel328 is soldered in correct orientation.
- Check if battery is connected. Device will not work without battery.
- Check if Atmel328 is OK at all: if it was working on original Arduino board.
- Check for shorts between chip pins.
- Check or replace resonator (if any). 
- Wipe flux from board.
- Replace Atmel328 and its related components.

### RTC FAIL on startup
- Check if RTC is soldered in correct orientation.
- Check if resistance for i2c line is not shorted or broken.
- Check if power is present on RTC chip.
- Check for shorts between chip pins.
- Wipe flux from board.
- Replace RTC and its related components.

### Select WTF After flash firmware
- Check if watchfaces count set correctly
- Check if watchfaces is included in firmware. 
- Add or uncomment watchfaces and flash again.

## Software > Used libraries
### LCD1202
Used to run nokia display. Also may be compatible with this LCD controllers: `pcf8814`, `ste2007`, `ST7565`, `HX1230`.
Library included in this repo. Just copy it to your libraries folder (`C:\Users\USER\Documents\Arduino\libraries`). \
This library is modified, to allow display flip options and direct access to buffer. So use version of library that included in this repository.
Source: http://arduino.ru/forum/proekty/khronograf-izmeritel-skorosti-puli-ot-prostogo-k-slozhnomu?page=5#comment-136147
### Low-Power-master
Used to allow deep sleep between screen refreshing. 
Library included in this repo. Just copy it to your libraries folder (`C:\Users\USER\Documents\Arduino\libraries`). \
Source: https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power
### DS3231M-1.0.6
Used to communicate with RTC module.
Library included in this repo. Just copy it to your libraries folder (`C:\Users\USER\Documents\Arduino\libraries`). \
Source: https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ds3231m/


## Software > How to build
- Install Arduino IDE.
I used Arduino 1.8.16.
Link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software ;
- Because Arduino IDE don't have drivers for CH340, you need to install drivers manually.
You can find drivers enywhere over Internet.
I found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BqUo6f5WEd1vqdxt1UWzDh4OgjdQ7Mx1/view ;
- Copy libraries to your Arduino IDE libraries folder;
- Open project and try to build it. If all steps done correctly, project will build successfully.


## Software > How to set language
There is 2 options to select language: `Russian` and `English`.\
If you want use `Russian` language, uncomment `#define LANG_RU` string in `Generic.cpp` file.\
If you want use `English` language, uncomment `#define LANG_EN` string in `Generic.cpp` file.\
Only one string can be active at the time. If you select any language, you have to comment other one.


## Software > How to set watchfaces list
You can include multiple watcfaces in firmware. As much as enough FLASH memory.\
You can configure included wathfaces in file `_DRMWatch2.ino`.\
Update number of included watchfaces, comment or uncomment needed watchfaces, check memory usage.\
If no watchface is included in firmware, "Select WTF" text will appear on watchfaces screen.\
Example:
<p align="center"><img src="Photos/config_watchfaces.jpg" width="300"/></p>


## Software > How to add your own watchface
Project has several watchfaces included, but you always can create your own watchface and use it.
Here's instruction how to do it:
- Create file like `WatchFaceMy.cpp` and inherit class `GenericWatchface`. Use other watchfaces as reference.
- Implement virtual methods of `GenericWatchface`. Detailed description of each method you can find in `GenericWatchface.cpp`. Use other watchfaces as reference.
- Function `drawWatchface` draws watchface. You can draw everything you want calling functions from `Display.cpp`.
`drawWatchface` have to be a non-blocking function, othervise watch will not work properly.
Use other watchfaces as reference.
- In file `_DRMWatch2.ino` include your `WatchFaceMy.cpp`. Use other watchfaces as reference.
- In file `_DRMWatch2.ino` in `setup()` function add your watchface to array. Use other watchfaces as reference.
- Update `watchfacesCount` if needed.
- Now update your watch firmware and you can select your new watchface and use it!


## Software > How to add your own application
You can modify source and add own application.
Program contains several screens (menus, applications).
Every screen is a separate `mode`. Every mode contains of: `modeSetup()`, `modeLoop()`, `modeFinish()`.
Modes can work independently. Modes divided into different files to ease.
Function of main program `loop()` is routing `modeLoop()` to correct mode according to `_mode` value.
Also `setMode()` function is triggering `modeSetup()` and `modeFinish()` for every mode.
To change mode call: `setMode(MODE_INIT);`.
When adding new mode: 
- Create new file with `modeLoop()`, `modeSetup()`, and `modeFinish()` for your mode.
- Define constant for it in main file, like `#define MODE_MENU_SET_BEEP_SOUND (byte)9`.
- Add to main `loop()` call for your `modeLoop()`.
- Call your `modeSetup()` from `setMode()` when entering your mode.
- Call your `modeFinish()` from `setMode()` when leaving your mode.
- Call `setMode(YOUR_MODE);` when you want to enter your new screen.
- Don't forget to call `goToWatchface()` or `setMode()` to exit your mode if needed.
- When your mode is active, only your mode's `loop()` will be called. 
So mode have all control over device. 
If your mode will be empty, so device will do nothing after activation your mode, 
and you can't even exit to menu or reboot if you don't implemented this.
- If you stuck with your mode, the easiest way to reboot watch is connect it to USB and reflash.


## Software > How to add your own melodies
Because of Arduino have <b>VERY</b> limited space, but I want to store long melodies, I made algorythm to 
compress music as much as possible.\
As source I using Nokia-style composer music, named `RTTTL`.\
I made software to convert `RTTTL` to binary codes, which can be played by synthesizer of 
DRM Watch firmware.\
Melodies stored in form of one byte-one note. Array is contains tempo and notes.\
First 2 bits of note is representing note duration (values 4, 8, 16, 32).\
Last 6 bits represents note number counted from low note of first octave.\
Software can be found in `Windows RTTTL to binary converter\RTTTL Converter\bin\Release\net5.0-windows` folder.
<p align="center"><img src="Photos/photo_2021-12-16_22-37-15.jpg" width="400"/></p>

To add your melody to melody list:
- Convert your RTTTL melody to binary array;
- In file `MelodyPlayer.ino` add array and `get...()` function with your melody;
- In file `ModeMenuMelodies.ino` in function `getMelodyByIndex()` add index for your melody;
- In file `ModeMenuMelodies.ino` in array `modeMenuMelodiesItems` add name of your melody;
- In file `myEEPROM.cpp` in constant `#define eepromMelodyCount` update melody count;
- Update firmware on your watch;
- Now your melody will appear in list and can be set as alarm.

# Project history
A long time ago...
## Project history > 2016, First steps
Back in 2016 me and my friend was playing with arduino and Nokia 5110 LCD.
Then idea of DRM Watch was born. Why "DRM"? It's first letters from my and my friend's nicknames:)
We've assembled one DIY working prototype and stopped development. \
Here's some prorotype photos of these days:

</p>

## Project history > 2021, Development continued
Later, in 2021 for some reason project continued. 
LCD was changed to Nokia 1280 LCD, because it is easier to get and has more reliable connection. 
Here's some prototypes:
